# Disease Predictor

This project consists of a Python Flask web application that provides an interactive user interface for predicting various diseases. The web app integrates six different prediction models which are trained differently for the following diseases:

 - [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/debasish-dutta/Breast-cancer-prediction)
 - [Diabetes](https://github.com/debasish-dutta/Diabetes-prediction)
 - [Heart Failure](https://github.com/debasish-dutta/heart-disease-project)
 - [Kidney Disease](https://github.com/debasish-dutta/Kidney-disease-prediction)
 - [Liver Disease](https://github.com/debasish-dutta/Liver-disease-prediction)
 - [Lung Cancer](https://github.com/debasish-dutta/Lung-cancer-prediction)

## Features

- Users can input relevant medical data to get predictions for the specific disease.
- Each disease prediction is handled by a separate prediction model.
- The web app provides user-friendly visualizations and explanations of the predictions.
- Results are displayed in real-time, providing quick and efficient disease risk assessment.
